# RPG_Game
Welcome to the RPG_Game web API application! This application allows players to create and manage characters, weapons and skills, and engage in epic battles against each other.

Built using .NET 6 and the ASP.NET Core web API framework, this application is designed to be fast, scalable, and easy to use. The application uses Entity Framework Core as the ORM to interact with the database and it's built on top of the ASP.NET Core web API framework. The application is also using dependency injection to make the code more testable and maintainable.

Players can create characters with unique abilities and weapons, and engage in combat against other characters. The application tracks the player's victories and defeats, making it easy to track progress.

The application also includes an API documentation generated using Swagger, which makes it easy to test and understand the endpoints.

This application serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to build their own RPG game or web API application using .NET 6. Feel free to use this application as a reference or a starting point for your own project.

The code is well-organized and commented, making it easy to understand and modify.

Please note that this is a sample application and there may be bugs and missing features, but it should give you a good idea of how you can use .NET 6 and ASP.NET Core to build a web API.

Thank you for checking out the RPG_Game web API application! Happy coding!
